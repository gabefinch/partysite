        <h1>Hello friends&#8230;</h1>
        <p>Allisa and Gabe were married last June on Anini Beach on the island of Kauai.  Twas a lovely time (more on that below)! We would have loved to invite all of you had we been able to accommodate your numbers. However, it has always been our intention to have some sort of mainland party/reception for all of our lovely family and friends. Better late than never.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, our marriage is bearing fruit (more on that below). So, this party will serve as a celebration of our marriage as well as a celebration of our coming tot/sprog/baby. Two birds, one stone. Two people (soon to be three), one family, one soir&eacute;e. Hopefully that's not too confusing. In any case, we hereby formally invite you. We would love to see you and to have you share in this celebration of our economy-size bundle of life changes.  Please be a dear and RSVP below so we can plan accordingly. We hope to see you there!</p>
        <p>Some of you don't know <i>both</i> of us well. Let us start with some introductions&#8230;</p>

      <p>Gabriel Seth Finch, all 9 lbs. 12 oz. of me, was born to Melissa Ann (Boles) Finch and Mark Steven Finch on April the 19th of 1978 at Sacred Heart Hospital in Eugene, Oregon. Nickname as baby: "Gunter the Grunter". I was preceded into this world by a sister (my only sibling), Hilary Nicole (Finch) Hutler, currently of Portland, Oregon.</p>

    <p>As long as I can remember I have loved drawing, being outdoors, and taking things apart. I feel very blessed to have gotten to grow up in the southern Willamette Valley and remember spending much of my childhood exploring something or other in dappled light under a canopy of big ol' trees.  I also love reading, and that love began with the national treasure that is Mad Magazine (shout out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman" target="_blank">Alfred E. Neuman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Aragon%C3%A9s" target="_blank">Sergio Aragones</a>). I sought out old issues on trips to thrift stores with my mother.  My sister and I both spent a lot of time playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVkR1Lzl7RM" target="_blank">video games</a> on an Atari 65XE home computer sent from Germany by our uncle Matt.</p>

    <p>High school was a hard time for me. I largely tried to keep my headphones on and avoid eye-contact. Teachers like Sue Markley and Janelle Youngblood helped keep me on track. One of our high school proctors, Mike Paup was a beacon of hope for me and a caring friend during these times.  I found my mothers Yamaha acoustic guitar in the attic and taught myself the bass line for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGqBM_r932s" target="_blank">Come As You Are</a>.</p>
    <p>After high school I studied painting, drawing and photography part-time at community college and worked at a variety of jobs over several years (t-shirt printer, dishwasher, line-cook, forklift operator, delivery driver, wildland firefighter). One of my hobbies during this time was fixing up old Schwinn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmey-Archer" target="_blank">Sturmey-Archer 3-speed</a> bicycles.  A girlfriend taught me how to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUK8emiWabU" target="_blank">Freight Train</a> on guitar, which opened up a whole new world of playing for me.</p>

    <p>In my mid-twenties I entered university full-time at the U. of O. and completed a B.Sci. in Biology. My degree led immediately to a position in Los Angeles studying the origins of the bone and cartilage that make up the skull.  I dislike car trips and I am the cheapest of cheapskates, so I didn't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtDhtadoeUk" target="_blank">love</a> L.A. Fortunately I was soon able to transfer to a position back in Portland, Oregon in the Lab of

      </a> helping with studies of the inner ear's mechanical workings.  I continued to work on bicycles and began taking longer bike trips, to the coast, to the cascades, etc.  I was also running a lot, and completed a half marathon with my friend Dylan.</p>

    <p>I worked as a research technician for eight years. It was during this time that I met Allisa (more on that below). Eventually in 2014, partly due to a bleak outlook for science research funding, I decided to embark on a relatively radical career change into computer programming. I enrolled in a <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">5-month programming school</a> at the start of 2015.  Finding programming employment was difficult at first, but I am now happily employed full-time and finding that I am not half bad at this programming stuff.  I'm hoping that, as a career choice, it will afford us the ability to stay in Portland where we have made so many wonderful friends.</p>

    <p>I was born into the bosom of the loving, generous Beymer clan of Eugene, Oregon. The day was May 31st, 1979, and the place was also Sacred Heart Hospital.  Mine was a musical family, and my earliest memories are of singing, listening to my mother sing as she played ukulele, listening to my mother &amp; father sing hymns in harmony, and listening to my two brothers practice piano on my father’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_piano" target="_blank">Rhodes</a>.  I also have happy memories of cousins, playing outside, being read to aloud every night by my dad, and my first cat, Cuddles.</p>

    </div>
    <p>I attended Santa Clara Elementary (now an empty field), and Madison Middle School, where I learned to read music and played the oboe in band for 4 years.  I attended North Eugene High School, where I remained blissfully sheltered under the umbrella of Music &amp; Drama, and the friendships found therein.  I performed with the Concert Choir and the Vocal Jazz Ensemble, was in 3 musicals (Fiddler on the Roof, Cinderella, and Joseph &amp; the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat), and competed in City &amp; State Vocal Competitions.  I also received the Hult Center’s very first Performing Arts Student of the Month Award.  High School was a happy time, and my best friend, Jenni Darby (Lanker) &amp; I watched a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTj4EWfR1z8" target="_blank">horror movies</a> and drove around Eugene blaring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHBmpGLGyk8" target="_blank">Sarah McLachlan</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIlg0yM0XKg" target="_blank">Cranberries</a>.</p>

    <p>After High School, I attended Northwest Nazarene College for one year before finishing my degree at the University of Oregon, graduating with a B.A. in Comparative Literature.  In these years, I discovered my love of travel, taking a term to study Spanish in Cuernavaca, Mexico, as well as traveling to Thailand for 2 weeks.  I also continued to pursue music in college, studying voice and guitar, and performing in U. of O.’s Eastern European Folk Ensemble and the Oregon Slavonic Choir.</p>

    <p>In 2002, I left Oregon for the deserts of Arizona, where I lived &amp; worked for 4 years (on &amp; off) at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Ranch" target="_blank">Phantom Ranch</a>, a dude ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, situated along the Colorado River.  This is an isolated place, only accessible by foot, mule or by the river.  Our small crew of 18 was a colorful band of misfits who made the most of our isolation, playing music and sharing stories late into the night, only to rise early the next day and take in the beauty of the canyon.  It was a time to connect with nature and dream as well as connect with ourselves and the parade of humanity that ventured the 9 miles of trail to reach us.  I treasure my memories of the heat, rafting the Colorado River, Rutha’s homemade fig bars, hiking up Phantom Creek, our famous 4th of July shindigs, howling at the moon and the canyon itself.</p>
    <p>In 2005, I took a hiatus from the ranch and travelled Europe for 9 months, volunteering along the way on 5 different farms through <a href="http://www.wwoof.net/" target="_blank">WWOOF</a> in France (St. Giron), Greece (Koroni &amp; Lesvos), Iceland (<a href="http://www.vallanes.is/en/" target="_blank">Vallanes</a>) and Hungary (Kiskunmajsa).  Any large adventure like this is bound to be life-changing, and my favorite memories include walking 130 miles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago" target="_blank">Camino de Santiago</a> in Northern Spain, riding a bike around the Aran Islands, Ireland, the mountains &amp; lakes of Switzerland, singing songs with strangers at hostels, tending olive groves and milking goats in Greece, feasting on roasted chestnuts &amp; sva&#345;&aacute;k in a snowy Prague square, eating hazelnut gelato every day in Italy, harvesting wild mushrooms &amp; blueberries in Iceland and all the kind, generous people I met along the way.  Altogether, I’ve been to 15 countries, and look forward to revisiting some of my favorites (Iceland, Ireland, Italy) as well as adding a few more to the list (New Zealand, India, Japan).</p>

    <p>I made the move to Portland, Oregon in 2006, to be closer to family and friends.  I’ve been working at <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/" target="_blank">New Seasons Market</a> almost ever since, starting in the bakery and currently working as a Bookkeeper at the Hawthorne location.  In the past ten years, I’ve spent my days cultivating a sense of self &amp; community.  I have enjoyed volunteering at Planned Parenthood, and through the Multnomah County Library’s outreach program.  I started practicing yoga &amp; meditation regularly, and have enjoyed retreats in Sayulita, Mexico and Breitenbush Hot Springs.  And although I’m not as avid a bicyclist as Gabe, I have enjoyed some bike trips, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_to_Portland_Bicycle_Classic" target="_blank">STP Classic</a> and multiple jaunts on the <a href="http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=104" target="_blank">Banks-Vernonia Trail</a>. Gabe &amp; I have also had the pleasure of performing for five years with our friend, Felix's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQUrF0O84bY" target="_blank">Cardboard Songsters</a> at the Pickathon Music Festival.</p>
    <p>More musical exploits include several band iterations with my best friend, Mandy Morgan; together, we have busked at a farmer’s market in France, performed at a music festival in Iceland, the Corona Music festival in Mexico City (headlined by Iggy Pop), and Portland’s own <a href="http://www.shift2bikes.org/cal/viewpp2016.php" target="_blank">Pedalpalooza</a> (for the infamous bike jousting tournament).  We anticipate the release of a record for our current band, Time &amp; the Bell, which features all songs written by Mandy &amp; myself.  Recording and mixing is currently being finished at Jackpot Studios in Portland, Oregon.</p>
    <p>And when I’m not meditating or playing music, I’m enjoying this simple list of my own personal passions:  baking, biking, hiking, yoga, reading, being with henri (my cat), laughing, entertaining, floating in the ocean (or any body of water), visits to my <a href="http://pdxdc.net/Dr._Peter_Leitner/Who_We_Are.html" target="_blank">chiropractor</a> &amp; <a href="http://greenlotusacupuncture.com/mary-jean-brinkman/" target="_blank">acupuncturist</a>, Gabe time, family time, girlfriend time and nature time!!!</p>

    <h1>The Couple</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/allisaportrait.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>Despite growing up in Eugene at the same time we never met as youngsters.  Allisa was finishing college at the U. of O. by the time Gabe got started there (slacker!).  When did we meet?  The truth is...we haven't exactly resolved that.  Maybe the first meeting was at a performance by Allisa's band. Or then again, maybe it was at one of Halle &amp; Ledena's famous acoustic covers parties. And our first date? Hmmm&#8230; it was either a Korean vampire movie at <a href="http://www.5thavecinema.com/" target="_blank">5th Ave Cinema</a> or an aphrodisiac-infused dinner that Allisa painstakingly prepared (vavavoom!). It depends on who you ask. Nevertheless, fall in love we did, and moved in together just 5 months into dating.  We still live in our cozy Sellwood apartment, going on six years now. In our time together we've weathered good times and bad: career changes and couples counseling, lake swimming and sunsets, bad backs and extreme diets, dinners together and foot rubs, mood swings, bike trips, misunderstandings and forgivings.  We’ve worked hard at the art of communication, division of house labor (shout out to my homie chore wheel), and can even sing in harmony (after some preliminary caterwauling).  Then, in the snow storm of February 2014, Gabe proposed to Allisa on an observation deck of the <a href="http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Oaks_Bottom_Loop_Hike" target="_blank">Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge</a> (near the party site fyi). Several <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Bufflehead/sounds" target="_blank">buffleheads</a> and <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Pintail/sounds" target="_blank">northern pintails</a> bore witness.

    <p>On June 19th, 2015 we were married on Anini Beach on the northeastern side of the island of Kauai.  We were so happy to have all of our closest family with us. This will always be a special memory for us. In Gabe’s words from his vows, “I asked you to marry me because I knew I would never find anyone like you again as long as I lived, and because I didn’t want to imagine a life without you in it.” And in Allisa’s words, “we have been stretched to our limits, beyond our breaking points, and into a new territory of self-awareness, self-acceptance and self-love… [which] also means that we have learned how to offer one another abundant amounts of awareness, acceptance, love.”</p>

    <!-- <p>We believe our strength lies in our differences; we challenge each other to be the best versions of ourselves and this is why we continue to prosper as partners.</p> -->

    <p>After our ceremony, the amazing people at Anahola Cafe threw us a reception with ono-licious food, wicker thrones for the bride and groom, and some sweet Jawaiian tunes.  While we were on the island, we hiked a section of the Na Pali Coast and swam in the pool of a waterfall, snorkeled with turtles and psychedelic wrasse, and took a catamaran ride and a helicopter ride. We stayed on the island for a couple extra weeks at a farm on Moloa'a Bay, where we had all the young coconut, lychee, lilikoi, mango, mountain apple, breadfruit, cacao, and noni we could eat. Through bad luck though, we never did get to have the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/shave-ice-tege-tege-kapaa" target="_blank">best shave ice on the island</a>, so unfortunately we will have to return!

    <p>We are very happy to announce that we’re expecting a little sweet-pea in early September. Allisa is already big at six months, so expect her to be very pregnant (and barefoot?) at the party. We are planning on a home birth and waiting for the birth to find out its gender. Gabe is in charge of boy's names while Allisa is responsible for the girl's names. We’ve had laughs and fights and more laughs over so many names that it will feel like a triumph when we can finally agree on a name. Please feel free to offer suggestions via the R.S.V.P. or at the party!</p>

Sellwood Park has basic bathroom amenities. New Seasons Market Sellwood store is nearby.</p>
    <p> Honestly, we would love just to have you attend. If you are so inclined, we do have a gift <a href="http://www.myregistry.com/wishlist/Allisa-Beymer-Gabe-Finch-Portland-OR/1084591" target="_blank">registry</a>. A separate wedding and baby gift is unnecessary. We also would love anything that you've made with your own hands.</p>
