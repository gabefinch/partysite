        <h1>Hello friends...</h1>
        <p>Allisa and Gabe were married last June on Anini Beach on the island of Kauai.  It was a small ceremony (more on that below). We would have liked to invite you all were that possible. It was however always our intention to have some sort of mainland party/reception for our lovely families and friends.  It has taken us longer than we hoped to put that together.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, our marriage is bearing fruit (more on that below). So this party is meant as a celebration of our marriage as well as a celebration of our coming tot/sprog/baby. Two birds, one stone. Two people (soon to be three), one family, one soir&eacute;e. Hopefully that's not too confusing. In any case, we have invited you because we would love to see you and to have you share in this celebration of our economy-size bundle of life changes.  Please be a dear and RSVP below so we can plan accordingly.</p>
        <p>Some of you don't know both of us well. Let us start with some introductions ...</p>

      <p>Gabriel Seth Finch, all 9lbs. 12 oz. of me, was born to Melissa Ann (Boles) Finch and Mark Steven Finch on April the 19th of 1978 at Sacred Heart Hospital in Eugene, Oregon.  I was preceded into this world by a sister (my only sibling), Hilary Nicole (Finch) Hutler, currently of Portland, Oregon.  I'm told my nickname as a baby was "Gunter the Grunter".</p>

    <p>As long as I can remember I have loved drawing, being outdoors, and taking things apart. I feel very blessed to have gotten to grow up in the southern Willamette Valley and remember spending much of my childhood exploring something or other in dappled light under a canopy of mature trees.  I also love reading, and that love began with the national treasure that is Mad Magazine (shout out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman" target="_blank">Alfred E. Neuman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Aragon%C3%A9s" target="_blank">Sergio Aragones</a>). I sought out old issues on trips to thrift store with my mother.  My sister and I both spent a lot of time playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVkR1Lzl7RM" target="_blank">video games</a> on an Atari 65XE home computer sent from Germany by our uncle Matt.</p>

    <p>High school was a hard time for me. I largely tried to keep my headphones on and avoid eye-contact. Teachers like Sue Markley and Janelle Youngblood helped keep me on track. One of our high school proctors, Mike Paup was a beacon of hope for me and a caring friend during these times.  I found my mothers Yamaha acousitc guitar in the attic and taught myself the bassline for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGqBM_r932s" target="_blank">Come As You Are</a></p>
    <p>After high school I studied painting, drawing and photography part-time at community college and worked at a variety of jobs over several years (t-shirt printer, dishwasher, line-cook, forklift operator, delivery driver, wildland firefighter). One of my hobbies during this time was fixing up old Schwinn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmey-Archer" target="_blank">Sturmey-Archer 3-speed</a> bicycles.  A girlfriend taught me how to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUK8emiWabU" target="_blank">Freight Train</a> on guitar, which opened up a whole new world of playing.</p>

    <p>In my mid-tweties I entered university full-time at the U. of O. and completed a B.S. in Biology. My degree led immediatelly to a position in Los Angeles studying formation of the bones and cartilage that make up the skull.  I dislike car trips and I am the cheapest of cheapskate, so I didn't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtDhtadoeUk" target="_blank">love L.A.</a> Fortunately I was soon able to transfer to a position back in Portland, Oregon in the Lab of

      </a> helping with studies of the inner ear's mechanical workings.  I continued to work on bicycles and began taking longer bike trips, to the coast, to the cascades, etc.  I was also running a lot, and completed a half marathon with my friend Dylan.</p>

    <p>I worked as a research technician for eight years. It was during this time that I met Allisa(more on that below). Eventually in 2014, partly due to a bleak outlook for science research funding, I decided to embark on a relatively radical career change into computer programming. I enrolled in a <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">5-month programming school</a> at the start of 2015.  Finding programming employment was difficult at first, but I am now happily employed full-time and finding that I am not half bad at this programming stuff.  I'm hoping that, as a career choice, it will afford us the ability to stay in Portland where we have made so many wonderful friends.</p>

    <h1>Dating, Coupledom, Mawiage</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/allisaportrait.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      The truth is, we can’t recall the first time we met. Both growing up in Eugene with many mutual friends, one would think that it was just a matter of time until we were aware of each other.   But was it at a Sukey Tawdry show that Mikah invited Gabe to see?  Or maybe it was at an infamous covers party hosted by Halle &amp; Ledena?  And was our first date that Korean vampire movie or the night Allisa cooked dinner for Gabe?  Our origin story remains clouded by speculative accounts… but fall in love, we did, and moved in together lighting fast -- just 5 months into dating.  We still live in our little Sellwood apartment, going on 6 years now, and our lives have gone through so many changes in this time: career moves and counseling, illness and diet switches, mood swings, bike trips, family gatherings and costumed performances in the woods.  We’ve worked hard to establish successful patterns of communication, division of house labor, and can even sing in harmony.  And in the February snow storm of 2014, Gabe proposed to Allisa on an observation deck of Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge.

      As many of you know, last June we pledged our commitment to each other in an intimate ceremony with family on a beach in Kauai.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will always be a special memory for us.  In Gabe’s words from his vows, “I asked you to marry me because I knew I would never find anyone like you again as long as I lived, and because I didn’t want to imagine a life without you in it.”  And in Allisa’s words, “we have been stretched to our limits, beyond our breaking points, and into a new territory of self-awareness, self-acceptance and self-love… [which] also means that we have learned how to offer one another abundant amounts of awareness, acceptance, love.”   We believe our strength lies in our differences; we challenge each other to be the best versions of ourselves and this is why we continue to prosper as partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      enjoyed an amazing wedding &amp; honeymoon in Kauai last June; hiked a section of the Na Pali Coast, snorkeled with turtles, took a catamaran and a helicopter ride and drank a fresh coconut every day.

      It’s been relatively smooth sailing thus far; we’re shooting for a home birth and are not finding out the gender beforehand.  The most entertaining past time since finding out has been sifting through the myriad of potential names; Gabe is in charge of boy names while Allisa is responsible for the girl names.  We’ve had laughs and fights and more laughs over so many names that it will feel like a triumph when we can finally agree on a name.  Please feel free to offer suggestions via email or at the party!
