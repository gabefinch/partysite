        <h1>Hello friends...</h1>
        <p>Allisa and Gabe were married last June on Anini Beach on the island of Kauai.  It was a small ceremony (more on that below). We would have liked to invite you had it been possible. However, it was always our intention to have some sort of mainland party/reception for our lovely families and friends.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, our marriage is bearing fruit (more on that below). So this party is meant as a celebration of our marriage as well as a celebration of our coming tot/sprog/baby. Two birds, one stone. Two people (soon to be three), one family, one soir&eacute;e. Hopefully that's not too confusing. In any case, we have invited you because we would love to see you and to have you share in this celebration of our economy-size bundle of life changes.  Please be a dear and RSVP below so we can plan accordingly.</p>
        <p>Some of you don't know both of us well. Let us start with some introductions ...</p>

      <p>Gabriel Seth Finch, all 9lbs. 12 oz. of me, was born to Melissa Ann (Boles) Finch and Mark Steven Finch on April the 19th of 1978 at Sacred Heart Hospital in Eugene, Oregon.  I was preceded into this world by a sister (my only sibling), Hilary Nicole (Finch) Hutler, currently of Portland, Oregon.  I'm told my nickname as a baby was "Gunter the Grunter".</p>

    <p>As long as I can remember I have loved drawing, being outdoors, and taking things apart. I feel very blessed to have gotten to grow up in the southern Willamette Valley and remember spending much of my childhood exploring something or other in dappled light under a canopy of mature trees.  I also love reading, and that love began with the national treasure that is Mad Magazine (shout out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_E._Neuman" target="_blank">Alfred E. Neuman</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Aragon%C3%A9s" target="_blank">Sergio Aragones</a>). I sought out old issues on trips to thrift stores with my mother.  My sister and I both spent a lot of time playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVkR1Lzl7RM" target="_blank">video games</a> on an Atari 65XE home computer sent from Germany by our uncle Matt.</p>

    <p>High school was a hard time for me. I largely tried to keep my headphones on and avoid eye-contact. Teachers like Sue Markley and Janelle Youngblood helped keep me on track. One of our high school proctors, Mike Paup was a beacon of hope for me and a caring friend during these times.  I found my mothers Yamaha acousitc guitar in the attic and taught myself the bassline for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGqBM_r932s" target="_blank">Come As You Are</a>.</p>
    <p>After high school I studied painting, drawing and photography part-time at community college and worked at a variety of jobs over several years (t-shirt printer, dishwasher, line-cook, forklift operator, delivery driver, wildland firefighter). One of my hobbies during this time was fixing up old Schwinn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmey-Archer" target="_blank">Sturmey-Archer 3-speed</a> bicycles.  A girlfriend taught me how to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUK8emiWabU" target="_blank">Freight Train</a> on guitar, which opened up a whole new world of playing.</p>

    <p>In my mid-twenties I entered university full-time at the U. of O. and completed a B.Sci. in Biology. My degree led immediatelly to a position in Los Angeles studying the origins of the bone and cartilage that make up the skull.  I dislike car trips and I am the cheapest of cheapskates, so I didn't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtDhtadoeUk" target="_blank">love</a> L.A. Fortunately I was soon able to transfer to a position back in Portland, Oregon in the Lab of

      </a> helping with studies of the inner ear's mechanical workings.  I continued to work on bicycles and began taking longer bike trips, to the coast, to the cascades, etc.  I was also running a lot, and completed a half marathon with my friend Dylan.</p>

    <p>I worked as a research technician for eight years. It was during this time that I met Allisa (more on that below). Eventually in 2014, partly due to a bleak outlook for science research funding, I decided to embark on a relatively radical career change into computer programming. I enrolled in a <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/" target="_blank">5-month programming school</a> at the start of 2015.  Finding programming employment was difficult at first, but I am now happily employed full-time and finding that I am not half bad at this programming stuff.  I'm hoping that, as a career choice, it will afford us the ability to stay in Portland where we have made so many wonderful friends.</p>

    <p>I was born into the bosom of the loving, generous Beymer clan of Eugene, Oregon. The day was May 31st, 1979, and the place was also Sacred Heart Hospital.  Mine was a musical family, and my earliest memories are of singing, listening to my mother sing as she played ukulele, listening to my mother &amp; father sing hymns in harmony, and listening to my two brothers practice piano on my father’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_piano" target="_blank">Rhodes</a>.  I also have happy memories of cousins, playing outside, being read to aloud every night by dad, and my first cat, Cuddles.</p>

      <img class="photothird" src="assets/images/allisajosh.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>
    <p>I attended Santa Clara Elementary (now an empty field), and Madison Middle School, where I learned to read music and played the oboe in band for 4 years.  I attended North Eugene High School, where I remained blissfully sheltered under the umbrella of Music &amp; Drama, and the friendships found therein.  I performed with the Concert Choir and the Vocal Jazz Ensemble, was in 3 musicals (Fiddler on the Roof, Cinderella, and Joseph &amp; the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat), and competed in City &amp; State Vocal Competitions.  I also received the Hult Center’s very first Performing Arts Student of the Month Award.  High School was a happy time, and my best friend, Jenni Darby (Lanker) &amp; I watched a lot of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTj4EWfR1z8" target="_blank">horror movies</a> and drove around Eugene blaring Sarah McLachlan and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIlg0yM0XKg" target="_blank">Cranberries</a>.</p>

    <p>After High School, I attended Northwest Nazarene College for one year before finishing my degree at the University of Oregon, graduating with a B.A. in Comparative Literature.  In these years, I discovered my love of travel, taking a term to study Spanish in Cuernavaca, Mexico, as well as traveling to Thailand for 2 weeks.  I also continued to pursue music in college, studying voice and guitar, and performing in U. of O.’s Eastern European Folk Ensemble and the Oregon Slavonic Choir.</p>

    <p>In 2002, I left Oregon for the deserts of Arizona, where I lived &amp; worked for 4 years (on &amp; off) at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Ranch" target="_blank">Phantom Ranch</a>, a dude ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, situated along the Colorado River.  This is an isolated place, only accessible by foot, mule or by the river.  Our small crew of 18 was a colorful band of misfits who made the most of our isolation, playing music and sharing stories late into the night, only to rise early the next day and take in the beauty of the canyon.  It was a time to connect with nature and dream as well as connect with ourselves and the parade of humanity that ventured the 9 miles of trail to reach us.  I treasure my memories of the heat, rafting the Colorado River, Rutha’s homemade fig bars, hiking up Phantom Creek, our famous 4th of July shindigs, howling at the moon and the canyon itself.</p>
    <p>In 2005, I took a hiatus from the ranch and travelled Europe for 9 months, volunteering along the way on 5 different farms through <a href="http://www.wwoof.net/" target="_blank">WWOOF</a> in France (St. Giron), Greece (Koroni &amp; Lesvos), Iceland (<a href="http://www.vallanes.is/en/" target="_blank">Vallanes</a>) and Hungary (Kiskunmajsa).  Any large adventure like this is bound to be life-changing, and my favorite memories include walking 130 miles of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago" target="_blank">Camino de Santiago</a> in Northern Spain, riding a bike around the Aran Islands, Ireland, the mountains &amp; lakes of Switzerland, singing songs with strangers at hostels, tending olive groves and milking goats in Greece, feasting on roasted chestnuts &amp; svařák in a snowy Prague square, eating hazelnut gelato every day in Italy, harvesting wild mushrooms &amp; blueberries in Iceland and all the kind, generous people I met along the way.  Altogether, I’ve been to 15 countries, and look forward to revisiting some of my favorites (Iceland, Ireland, Italy) as well as adding a few more to the list (New Zealand, India, Japan).</p>

    <p>I made the move to Portland, Oregon in 2006, to be closer to family and friends.  I’ve been working at <a href="http://www.newseasonsmarket.com/" target="_blank">New Seasons Market</a> almost ever since, starting in the bakery and currently working as a Bookkeeper at the Hawthorne location.  In the past ten years, I’ve spent my days cultivating a sense of self &amp; community.  I have enjoyed volunteering at Planned Parenthood, and through the Multnomah County Library’s outreach program.  I started practicing yoga &amp; meditation regularly, and have enjoyed retreats in Sayulita, Mexico and Breitenbush Hot Springs.  And although I’m not as avid a bicyclist as Gabe, I have enjoyed some bike trips, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_to_Portland_Bicycle_Classic" target="_blank">STP Classic</a> and multiple jaunts on the <a href="http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=104" target="_blank">Banks-Vernonia Trail</a>.</p>
    <p>More musical exploits include several band iterations with my best friend, Mandy Morgan; together, we have busked at a farmer’s market in France, performed at a music festival in Iceland, the Corona Music festival in Mexico City (headlined by Iggy Pop), and Portland’s own <a href="http://www.shift2bikes.org/cal/viewpp2016.php" target="_blank">Pedalpalooza</a> (for the infamous bike jousting tournament).  We anticipate the release of a record for our current band, Time &amp; the Bell, which features all songs written by Mandy &amp; myself.  Recording and mixing is currently being finished at Jackpot Studios in Portland, Oregon.</p>
    <p>And when I’m not meditating or playing music, I’m enjoying this simple list of my own personal passions:  baking, biking, hiking, yoga, reading, being with henri (my cat), laughing, entertaining, floating in the ocean (or any body of water), visits to my <a href="http://pdxdc.net/Dr._Peter_Leitner/Who_We_Are.html" target="_blank">chiropractor</a> &amp; <a href="http://greenlotusacupuncture.com/mary-jean-brinkman/" target="_blank">acupuncturist</a>, Gabe time, family time, girlfriend time and nature time!!!</p>

    <h1>Dating, Coupledom, Mawiage</h1>
    <img src="assets/images/allisaportrait.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      The truth is, we can’t recall the first time we met. Both growing up in Eugene with many mutual friends, one would think that it was just a matter of time until we were aware of each other.   But was it at a Sukey Tawdry show that Mikah invited Gabe to see?  Or maybe it was at an infamous covers party hosted by Halle &amp; Ledena?  And was our first date that Korean vampire movie or the night Allisa cooked dinner for Gabe?  Our origin story remains clouded by speculative accounts… but fall in love, we did, and moved in together lighting fast -- just 5 months into dating.  We still live in our little Sellwood apartment, going on 6 years now, and our lives have gone through so many changes in this time: career moves and counseling, illness and diet switches, mood swings, bike trips, family gatherings and costumed performances in the woods.  We’ve worked hard to establish successful patterns of communication, division of house labor, and can even sing in harmony.  And in the February snow storm of 2014, Gabe proposed to Allisa on an observation deck of Oaks Bottom Wildlife Refuge.

      As many of you know, last June we pledged our commitment to each other in an intimate ceremony with family on a beach in Kauai.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will always be a special memory for us.  In Gabe’s words from his vows, “I asked you to marry me because I knew I would never find anyone like you again as long as I lived, and because I didn’t want to imagine a life without you in it.”  And in Allisa’s words, “we have been stretched to our limits, beyond our breaking points, and into a new territory of self-awareness, self-acceptance and self-love… [which] also means that we have learned how to offer one another abundant amounts of awareness, acceptance, love.”   We believe our strength lies in our differences; we challenge each other to be the best versions of ourselves and this is why we continue to prosper as partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      enjoyed an amazing wedding &amp; honeymoon in Kauai last June; hiked a section of the Na Pali Coast, snorkeled with turtles, took a catamaran and a helicopter ride and drank a fresh coconut every day.

    <p>
      It’s been relatively smooth sailing thus far; we’re shooting for a home birth and are not finding out the gender beforehand.  The most entertaining past time since finding out has been sifting through the myriad of potential names; Gabe is in charge of boy names while Allisa is responsible for the girl names.  We’ve had laughs and fights and more laughs over so many names that it will feel like a triumph when we can finally agree on a name.  Please feel free to offer suggestions via email or at the party!
